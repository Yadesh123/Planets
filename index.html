                <h1> What is a planet? </h1>
                <p> We might be fond of the planets <em> Earth </em> and 
                <em> Mars </em>, but do we know WHY they are referred to 
                as a planet when <em> Pluto </em> and <em> Ceres </em> aren't?
                Well, according to what the IAU said in 2006, planets should...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Orbit a star </li>
                    <li> Be big enough for enough gravity to force them into a
                        sphere </li>
                    <li> Have a clean space around it </li>
                </ul>
                <p> It was found that Pluto and some other "planets" didn't follow
                    any of these! Do you think this list should be changed? </p>

                <h1> Mercury </h1>
                <p> This planet is the tiniest planet in the solar system- but as they say, it is the fastest! In fact, its name comes from the roman god <em> Mercury </em> because of its speed. It orbits the sun egg shapedly, with a speed of 47 kilometres per second. Each Mercury year is 88 days. It is the first planet, meaning the closest planet to the sun, having a distance of 0.4 Astronomical units (AU). Appearance wise, it is rocky, almost
                like the Earth, so it would be a <strong> terrestrial planet </strong>. </p>

                <h1> Venus </h1>
                <p> Venus is the second planet away from the sun. It is named
                    after the roman goddess of love and beauty. Its mass
                    makes it often be referred to as Earth's "twin". It is also
                    (almost) Earth's twin in the sense that it orbits the sun
                    every 224.7 Earth days. It, like antecedently mentioned 
                    <strong> Mercury </strong>, is a terrestrial planet, which 
                    as mentioned means rocky. It has the densest atmosphere of 
                    the four terrestrial planets. </p>

                <h1> Earth </h1>
                <p> This planet needs NO introduction! It is the planet we live in. This 
                    planet was formed over 4.5 <u> billion </u> years ago, and humans 
                    were said to occur in this vast planet in the first billion years.
                    As you might already know, an Earth year is 365 days, thus, we can
                    infer that the Earth takes 365 days to orbit the sun. 
                    It is the third planet from the sun. About 71% of its atmosphere is 
                    h2o and the other 29% is land. It is mostly composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen" target="_blank"> Nitrogen </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen" target="_blank"> Oxygen </a>.

                <h1> Mars </h1>
                <p> Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It has a very thin atmosphere, made of
                    mostly CO2, Nitrogen, Argon, and some oxygen/water vapour. A Mars day is more than 24 hours! You might be familiar with Mars quite a bit due to the countless amount of missions the world faced that were associated with this auspicious 
                    planet (ex. <em> Perseverance </em> and <em> Curiosity </em>)! Mars has two mooons, namely <em> Phobos </em> and <em> Deimos </em>. <strong> Fun fact </strong>: Although Mars may seem hot because of its red colour, it is   actually extremely cold.</p>

                    <h1> Jupiter </h1>
                    <p> The fifth planet from the sun is the lovely Jupiter. This planet was also
                        named after a roman god. That roman god is the KING OF ALL GODS! This planet, as funny as it sounds, is indeed a <strong> gas </strong> giant!. It is composed of mostly hydrogen. A special thing about the planet is that its moon count is abundant- it has eighty moons! But this number isn't even the largest in the solar system! (yet)</p>

                    <h1> Saturn </h1>
                    <p> One of the most talked about planets is indeed Saturn. This is because
                        of its special ring! Its radius is nine and a half times the Earth's, and 
                        additionally, it is noted to be 95 times larger than the Earth. It is named
                        after the god Saturn. It has 3 more moons than Jupiter (83 moons). <br/> This planet is so auspicious that a day was made for it. The seventh day of the week
                        Saturday is Saturn day (in Roman culture).

                    <h1> Uranus </h1>
                    <p> The seventh planet away from the sun is Uranus! It is a fun name, but the planet deserves a lot of respect. It is named after the greek god Uranus, who is said to be the great grandfather of ares and the grandfather of the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus" target="_blank"> Zeus </a>! It was found in March 13, 1781 by William Herschel, who was also the founder of two of Saturn's moons. Uranus has many moons like Saturn and Jupiter. However, as this planet is far, it takes
                    84 years to orbit the sun. Woah!

                    <h1>Neptune </h1>
                    <p> Finally, we have Neptune. This planet was discovered by three people: Johann Gelle, Urbain Le Verrier, and John Couch Adams in September the 23rd of 1846. It was named after the Roman god of the Sea and its symbol represents that god's trident. It is therefore the farthest away from the sun. It is the fourth largest planet in diameter. It is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, like Saturn. It, along with Uranus, is an <strong> ICE GIANT </strong> planet.
